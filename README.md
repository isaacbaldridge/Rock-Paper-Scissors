# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This was my first project using Python3. A simple rock, paper, scissors game to get used to the Python syntax after coming from a JS background.

## Set-Up
0.) Ensure that you have [Python installed](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-from-the-full-installer) on your machine.

1.) Fork the repo and clone it down using the SSH key. Copy and paste code below in your preferred directory in your terminal.
`git clone git@github.com:isaacbaldridge/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git`

2.) Run the main.py file.

3.) You will be prompted in the terminal to enter your choice of "rock", "paper" or "scissors".

4.) The CPU will choose an option at random, and the round will end with the winner deteremined.

5.) Run the file again to play again.
